    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>I'm currently building my front-end development skills, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm eager to learn and apply these technologies to create engaging and user-friendly web experiences.  I also have a foundational understanding of Java, C++, and the basics of BC, which I'm continuing to explore.</p>
